- Uses AI and computer vision to scan rooms and generate precise digital floor plans.  
- Automatically detects walls, windows, doors, and furniture.  
- Allows users to edit and refine the layout for accuracy.  

### **2. AR-Based Furniture Placement**  
- Enables users to place and rearrange furniture interactively using AR.  
- Provides a catalog of furniture that can be resized, rotated, and repositioned in real-time.  
- Enhances visualization for better space planning.  

### **3. Real-Time Wall Color & Lighting Simulation**  
- Simulates how different wall colors and finishes appear under natural and artificial lighting.  
- Provides instant visual feedback to help users choose the best aesthetic.  

### **4. Space Optimization Insights**  
- AI-powered analysis of room dimensions, furniture placement, and circulation space.  
- Provides recommendations to enhance space functionality and ergonomics.  

### **5. Collaboration & Export Options**  
- Enables real-time co-editing and feedback among architects, designers, and clients.  
- Supports exporting floor plans in multiple formats for seamless sharing.
